# Explorer for Workspace Visibility

-> **Note:** The explorer for workspace visibility is in beta and under active development.

As your organization grows, keeping track of your sprawling infrastructure estate can get increasingly more complicated. The explorer for workspace visibility helps surface a wide range of valuable information from across your organization.

Open the explorer for workspace visibility by clicking **Explorer** in your organization's top-level side navigation.

The **Explorer** page displays buttons grouped by **Types** and **Use Cases**. Each button offers a new view into your organization or workspace's data. Clicking a button triggers the explorer to perform a query and display the results in a table of data.

The **Types** buttons present generic use cases. For example, "Workspaces" displays a paginated and unfiltered list of your organization's workspaces and each workspace's accompanying data. The **Use Cases** buttons present sorted and filtered results to give you a focused view of your organizational data.

You can sort each column of the explorer results table. Clicking a hyperlinked field shows increasingly specific views of your data. For example, a workspace's modules count field links to a view of that workspace's associated modules. 

Clearing a query takes you back to the explorer landing page. To clear a query, click the back arrow at the top left of your current explorer view page.

## Permissions

The explorer for workspace visibility requires access to a broad range of an organization's data. To use the explorer, you must have either of the following organization permissions:
- [Organization owner](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners)
- [View all workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#view-all-workspaces) or greater

## Types

The explorer for workspace visibility supports four types:

- [Workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces)
- [Modules](/terraform/language/modules)
- [Providers](/terraform/language/providers)
- [Terraform Versions](/terraform/language/upgrade-guides#upgrading-to-terraform-v1-4)

## Use cases

The explorer for workspace visibility provides the following queries for specific use cases:

- **Top module versions** shows modules sorted by usage frequency.
- **Latest Terraform versions** displays a sorted list of Terraform versions in use.
- **Top provider versions** lists providers sorted by usage frequency.
- **Workspaces without VCS** lists workspaces not backed by VCS.
- **Workspace VCS source** lists VCS-backed workspaces sorted by repository name.
- **Workspaces with failed checks** lists workspaces that failed at least one [continuous validation](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/health#continuous-validation) check.
- **Drifted workspaces** displays [workspaces with drift](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/health#drift-detection) and relevant drift information.
- **Workspace VCS source** displays a subset of workspace data sorted by the underlying VCS repository.
- **All workspace versions** is a simplified view of your workspaces with current run and version information.
- **Runs by status** provides a run-focused view by sorting workspaces by their current run status.
- **Top Terraform versions** lists all Terraform versions by usage frequency
- **Latest updated workspaces** displays your most recently updated workspaces.
- **Oldest applied workspaces** sorts workspaces by the date of the current applied run.

## Custom filter conditions

Explorer's query builder allows you to execute queries with custom filter
conditions against any of the supported [**Types**](#types).

To get started, select a [**Type**](#types) or [**Use Case**](#use-cases) from the
Explorer home page. You can expand the "Modify conditions" section to show the
filter conditions in use for the current query and to define new filter
conditions.

![Explorer Query Builder](/img/docs/query-builder.png)

Each filter condition is represented by a row of inputs, each made up of a
target field, operator, and value.

The field dropdown allows you to select the target field for the condition. The
options available will vary based on the [**Type**](#types) used.

The operator dropdown allows you to select the operator for the condition. The
options available will vary based on the target field's data type.

Finally, the value field allows you to provide a value for the condition.

-> **Tip:** Inspect the filter conditions used by the various pre-canned [**Use
Cases**](#use-cases) to learn how they are constructed.

Multiple filter conditions can be used within a query. When multiple conditions
are provided, they are evaluated at query time with a logical AND. To add a new
condition, use the "Add condition" button below the condition list. To remove a
condition, use the trash bin button on the right hand side of the condition.

While you stage updates to filter conditions using the query builder, query
results will not be re-evaluated automatically. To execute the query once
the desired filter conditions have been defined, press the "Run Query" button at
the bottom of the query builder.
