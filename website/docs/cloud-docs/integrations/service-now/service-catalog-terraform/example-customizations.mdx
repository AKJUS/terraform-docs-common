# Example Customizations

## Customizing a Catalog Item

This example use case creates a Terraform Catalog Item for requesting resources
with custom variable values passed to the Terraform configuration.

### Make a copy of the existing Catalog Item

The application provides pre-configured [Catalog
Items](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)
for immediate use. Make a copy of the most appropriate Catalog Item for your
specific business requirements by following these steps:

1. Review the available Catalog Items and identify those based on Flows, which
   are denoted by the suffix "Flow" in their names. When selecting a Catalog
   Item, it is highly recommended to choose those based on Flows rather than
   Workflows. Flows represent ServiceNow's latest and more advanced solution
   compared to Workflows. Flows provide enhanced functionality, improved
   performance, and are actively supported and developed by ServiceNow. On the
   other hand, Workflows are an older technology and may have limited support
   and updates in the future (for more information, refer to the documentation
   on [Catalog Items based on Flows vs.
   Workflows]/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions).
1. Open the chosen Catalog Item in the editing mode: 
   a. Click on the Catalog Item to open the request form. 
   b. Click on the three dots located in the top right corner of the screen. 
   c. Select "Configure Item" from the menu.
1. Access the "Process Engine" tab within the Catalog Item configuration. Take
   note of the Flow name associated with the Catalog Item, as you will need to
   create a copy of this Flow as well.
1. Initiate the copying process: a. Click on the "Copy" button. b. Assign a new
   name to the copied Catalog Item. c. Optionally, modify the description and
   short description fields to better reflect the purpose of the new Catalog
   Item. Right-clik on the header and select "Save".

By following these steps, you can create a customized Catalog Item tailored to
your specific business needs, using the pre-existing Catalog Items as a starting
point.

### Adjust the Variable Set

When selecting a Catalog Item that requires end users to input variable values,
you have the ability to tailor the variable set according to your needs.
Although some default Catalog Items come with pre-defined example variables, it
is common practice to remove these and replace them with your own custom
variables. The manner in which the example variables are configured and
transmitted to the backend scripts of the application can serve as a helpful
reference when defining your own variables.

### Make a copy of the Action

### Make a copy of the Flow

This example uses the "Provision Resources With Vars" flow, which is an example of flows with actions, included with the integration.

In the ServiceNow Studio:

1. Navigate to "Flow Designer" > "Flows" > "Provision Resources With Vars".
   1. This will be flow that can be used as an example.
1. Create a new flow by selecting "New" in Flow Designer
1. Name it "Example Flow" and click "submit"
1. Edit your example flow
   1. Trigger: Service Catalog
   1. 1st Action: Get Catalog Variables
      1. Drag "Requested Item Record" to "Submitted Request" field
      1. Template Catalog Item: This should be your example catalog item created above
      1. Catalog Variables: Move all of your variables to "Selected" side
      1. Select "Done" to finish this action
   1. Add another action and select the "Terraform Create Workspace with Var"
      1. Using the Flow "Provision Resources With Vars" as an example:
      1. Move the variables from the "Data" options on the right of the flow designer to match the example flow
      1. Select "Done" to save this flow
1. Click "Save" then "Activate" to enable your flow

### Set the Flow for Catalog Item

In the ServiceNow Studio:

1. Select the "Example with Pinned Variables" catalog item. ("Service Catalog" > "Catalog Item" > "Example With Pinned Variables")
1. Select the "Process Engine" tab.
1. Set the "Flow" field by searching for the "Example Pinned Variables" flow and clicking "Update".

### Test the Catalog Item

The new item should be available in the Terraform Service Catalog.
