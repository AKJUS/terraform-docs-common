# Create a stack

Stacks enable you to provision and coordinate your infrastructure lifecycle at scale, offering an organized and reusable approach that expands upon infrastructure as code (IaC). 

> **Hands-on**: Try out the [Deploy a Stack with HCP Terraform](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/stacks-deploy) tutorial to get started with stacks quickly.

This article explains how to use a stack’s configuration and deployment configuration files to create a stack in HCP Terraform.

## Requirements

Stacks are not available for users on legacy HCP Terraform team plans. Learn more about [migrating to current HCP Terraform plans](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/migrate-teams-standard). 

To create a stack in HCP Terraform, you must set up the following:
* [Connect a VCS provider](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs) with either the Github App, GitHub OAuth workflow, or a GitLab VCS workflow.
* A repository with a top-level [stack configuration file](/terraform/language/stacks/create/config) that contains at least one `component` block and a [deployment configuration file](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfdeploy) with at least one `deployment` block.

You must also be a member of a team in your organization with one of the following permissions:
* [Organization-level **Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects)
* [Project-level **Maintain**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#maintain) or higher

## ## Create a stack

If you are creating a stack in an organization for the first time, you may need to first enable stacks for your organization. Go to your organization’s **Settings** page, and in the **General** settings check the box next to **Stacks** to enable stacks for your organization. 

Stacks live alongside workspaces in a project. To create a new stack in HCP Terraform, perform the following steps:

1. In the navigation menu, click **Projects** under **Manage**.  
1. Select the project where you want to create your stack.  
1. In the project's navigation menu, select **Stacks**.  
1. Click **+ New stack**.  
1. Select a version control provider from the list.  
1. Choose an organization and repository from the filterable list. If your repository is missing, enter its ID in the text field below the list. The list only displays the first 100 repositories from your VCS provider.  
1. Enter a new **Stack Name**.   
    * The name must be unique within the project and can include letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (_). We recommend using 90 characters or less for the name of your stack.   
1. You can optionally add a description for your stack.  
1. You can optionally adjust your version control settings by expanding **Advanced Options.**  
    * By default, stacks automatically trigger new plans when you push to your repositories’ default branch. You can deactivate this by toggling the **VCS Trigger Enabled** setting.  
    * You can also configure stacks to work from either a branch or tag-based workflow.   
    * By default, HCP Terraform fetches your stack’s configuration after creating your stack. To fetch your stack configuration manually, uncheck **Fetch configuration after HCP Terraform creates stack.**  
1. Click **Create Stack**.

## What's next
After creating your stack, you can continue to iterate on your configuration and [review configuration versions](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/configuration-versions) or you can [review your stack’s plans to deploy](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans).
