# Configure a stack

This guide explains how to configure a stack’s name, description, and VCS settings in HCP Terraform.

## Requirements

To view a stack and its configurations, you must also be a member of a team in your organization with one of the following permissions:

* [Organization-level **Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects) or higher  
* [Project-level **Maintain**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#maintain) or higher

## Configure a stack

You can configure a stack by performing the following steps:

1. In the navigation menu, click **Projects** under **Manage**.  
1. Select the project containing your stack.  
1. Click **Stacks** in the navigation menu.  
1. Select the stack you want to configure.  
1. Click **Stack settings** in the navigation menu.  
1. Update any of the following settings:  
   * Name   
   * Description  
   * Version control settings
        * By default, stacks automatically trigger new plans when you push to your repositories’ default branch. You can deactivate this by toggling the **VCS Trigger Enabled** setting.  
        * You can also configure stacks to work from either a branch or tag-based workflow.   
        * By default, HCP Terraform fetches your stack’s configuration after creating your stack. To fetch your stack configuration manually, uncheck **Fetch configuration after HCP Terraform creates stack**.  
1. Click **Save settings** to apply your changes.

## What's next
After configuring your stack, you can learn more about how to [review your stack’s deployment plans](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans) or [destroy your stack](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/destroy).
