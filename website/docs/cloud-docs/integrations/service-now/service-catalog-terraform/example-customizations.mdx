# Example Customizations

## Customizing a Catalog Item

This example use case creates a Terraform Catalog Item for requesting resources
with custom variable values passed to the Terraform configuration.

### Make a copy of the existing Catalog Item

The application provides pre-configured [Catalog
Items](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)
for immediate use. Make a copy of the most appropriate Catalog Item for your
specific business requirements by following these steps:

1. Review the available Catalog Items and identify those based on Flows, which
   are denoted by the suffix "Flow" in their names. When selecting a Catalog
   Item, it is highly recommended to choose those based on Flows rather than
   Workflows. Flows represent ServiceNow's latest and more advanced solution
   compared to Workflows. Flows provide enhanced functionality, improved
   performance, and are actively supported and developed by ServiceNow. On the
   other hand, Workflows are an older technology and may have limited support
   and updates in the future (for more information, refer to the documentation
   on [Catalog Items based on Flows vs.
   Workflows](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)).
1. Open the chosen Catalog Item in the editing mode: 
   1. Click on the Catalog Item to open the request form. 
   1. Click on the three dots located in the top right corner of the screen. 
   1. Select "Configure Item" from the menu.
1. Access the "Process Engine" tab within the Catalog Item configuration. Take
   note of the Flow name associated with the Catalog Item, as you will need to
   create a copy of this Flow as well.
1. Initiate the copying process: 
   1. Click on the "Copy" button. 
   1. Assign a new name to the copied Catalog Item. 
   1. Optionally, modify the description and short description fields to better
   reflect the purpose of the new Catalog Item. Right-click on the header and
   select "Save".

By following these steps, you can create a customized Catalog Item tailored to
your specific business needs, using the pre-existing Catalog Items as a starting
point.

### Adjust the Variable Set

When selecting a Catalog Item that requires end users to input variable values,
you have the ability to tailor the variable set according to your needs.
Although some default Catalog Items come with pre-defined example variables, it
is common practice to remove these and replace them with your own custom
variables. The manner in which the example variables are configured and
transmitted to the backend scripts of the application can serve as a helpful
reference when defining your own variables.

1. Create a new Variable Set.
   1. On the Catalog Item's configuration page, navigate to the Variable Sets tab.
   1. Click the "New" button to create your own Variable Set. Ensure that the
   variables in your new set match the variables required by your Terraform
   configuration.
   1. Select "Single-Row Variable Set" and provide a title and description.
   Click "Submit". Upon submission, you will be redirected back to the Catalog
   Item's configuration page.
   1. Click on the name of your newly created Variable Set and begin creating
   variables. Click the "New" button to create a new variable. It is important
   to follow the [naming convention for Terraform
   variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#terraform-variables-and-servicenow-variable-sets)
   when providing a variable name. Failure to follow the naming convertion will
   result in the backend scripts not recognizing it as Terraform variables.
   ServiceNow offers various types of variable representation (strings,
   booleans, dropdown menues, etc.). Consult the [ServiceNow documentation on
   variables](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ServiceCatalogVariables.html&version=latest)
   and select the types that best suit your use case. You can also set default
   values for the variables, which will be prefilled for the end users on the
   request form. Create as many variables as required by your Terraform
   configuration.
2. Attach the newly created Variable Set to your custom Catalog Item and remove
the default Workspace Variables.
   1. Return to the Variable Sets tab on the Catalog Item's configuration page
   and click the "Edit" buttton. 
   1. Move the "Workspace Variables" Set from the right side to the left side and
   click "Save". This action will remove the example variables from the form,
   leaving only your custom variables. You should not remove the "Workspace
   Request Create" or the "Workspace Request Update" Sets, as they contain
   mandatory variables and should not be modified.

### Make a copy of the Action

### Make a copy of the Flow

This example uses the "Provision Resources With Vars" flow, which is an example of flows with actions, included with the integration.

In the ServiceNow Studio:

1. Navigate to "Flow Designer" > "Flows" > "Provision Resources With Vars".
   1. This will be flow that can be used as an example.
1. Create a new flow by selecting "New" in Flow Designer
1. Name it "Example Flow" and click "submit"
1. Edit your example flow
   1. Trigger: Service Catalog
   1. 1st Action: Get Catalog Variables
      1. Drag "Requested Item Record" to "Submitted Request" field
      1. Template Catalog Item: This should be your example catalog item created above
      1. Catalog Variables: Move all of your variables to "Selected" side
      1. Select "Done" to finish this action
   1. Add another action and select the "Terraform Create Workspace with Var"
      1. Using the Flow "Provision Resources With Vars" as an example:
      1. Move the variables from the "Data" options on the right of the flow designer to match the example flow
      1. Select "Done" to save this flow
1. Click "Save" then "Activate" to enable your flow

### Set the Flow for Catalog Item

In the ServiceNow Studio:

1. Select the "Example with Pinned Variables" catalog item. ("Service Catalog" > "Catalog Item" > "Example With Pinned Variables")
1. Select the "Process Engine" tab.
1. Set the "Flow" field by searching for the "Example Pinned Variables" flow and clicking "Update".

### Test the Catalog Item

The new item should be available in the Terraform Service Catalog.
