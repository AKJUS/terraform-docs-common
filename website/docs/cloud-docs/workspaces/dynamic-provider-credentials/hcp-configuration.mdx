# Dynamic Credentials with the HCP Provider

~> **Important:** If you are self-hosting [Terraform Cloud agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents), ensure your agents use [v1.15.1](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog#1-15-1-05-01-2024) or above. To use the latest dynamic credentials features, [upgrade your agents to the latest version](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog).

You can use HCP Terraform’s native OpenID Connect integration with HCP to get [dynamic credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials) for the HCP provider in your HCP Terraform runs. Configuring the integration requires the following steps:

1. **[Configure HCP](#configure-hcp):** Set up a trust configuration between HCP and HCP Terraform. Then, you must create an [service principal in HPC](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/service-principals) for your HCP Terraform workspaces.
2. **[Configure HCP Terraform](#configure-hcp-terraform):** Add environment variables to the HCP Terraform workspaces where you want to use Dynamic Credentials.

Once you complete the setup, HCP Terraform automatically authenticates to HCP during each run.

## Configure HCP
You must enable and configure a workload identity pool and provider on HCP. These instructions use the HCP CLI, but you can also use Terraform to configure HCP. Refer to our [example Terraform configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-dynamic-credentials-setup-examples/tree/main/hcp).

#### Create a Service Principal
You will need to create a service principal for HCP Terraform to assume during runs. Remember the ID of the service principal as you will need it for the next steps.

```shell
hcp iam service-principals create hcp-terraform --project=HCP_PROJECT_ID
```

You should then grant this service princpal the permissions it needs to manage your infrastructure during runs.

```shell
hcp projects add-binding \
  --project=HCP_PROJECT_ID \
  --member=HCP_PRINCIPLE_ID \
  --role=roles/contributor
```

#### Add a Workload Identity Provider

Now you'll need to create the workload identity provider which HCP will use to authenticate the HCP Terraform run.

```shell
hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc hcp-terraform-dynamic-credentials \
  --service-principal=iam/project/HCP_PROJECT_ID/service-principal/hcp-terraform \
  --issuer=https://app.terraform.io \
  --allowed-audience=hcp.workload.identity
  --conditional-access='jwt_claims.sub matches `^organization:ORG_NAME:project:PROJECT_NAME:workspace:WORKSPACE_NAME:run_phase:.*`' \
  --description="Allow HCP Terraform agents to act as the hcp-terraform service principal"
```

## Configure HCP Terraform
You’ll need to set some environment variables in your HCP Terraform workspace in order to configure HCP Terraform to authenticate with HCP using dynamic credentials. You can set these as workspace variables, or if you’d like to share one HCP service principal across multiple workspaces, you can use a variable set.

### Required Environment Variables
| Variable                                    | Value                                                                                                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TFC_HCP_PROVIDER_AUTH`                     | `true`                                                                                               | Requires **v1.15.1** or later if self-managing agents. Must be present and set to `true`, or HCP Terraform will not attempt to use dynamic credentials to authenticate to HCP.                                                                                                                                           |

Optional if `PLAN_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME` and `APPLY_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME` are both provided. These variables are described [below](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/hcp-configuration#optional-environment-variables) |

### Optional Environment Variables
You may need to set these variables, depending on your use case.

| Variable                                      | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TFC_HCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE`          | Will be used as the `aud` claim for the identity token. Defaults to the provider resource name for the current run phase that was derived from the values you provided for `RUN_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME`, `PLAN_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME`, and `APPLY_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME` | Requires **v1.15.1** or later if self-managing agents. This is one of the default `aud` formats that HCP accepts.                          |
| `TFC_HCP_PLAN_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME`         | The resource name of the workload identity provider that will be used to assume the service principal for the plan phase of a run.                                                                                                                                         | Requires **v1.15.1** or later if self-managing agents. Will fall back to the value of `RUN_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME` if not provided.        |
| `TFC_HCP_APPLY_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME`        | The resource name of the workload identity provider that will be used to assume the service principal for the apply phase of a run.                                                                                                                                        | Requires **v1.15.1** or later if self-managing agents. Will fall back to the value of `RUN_PROVIDER_RESOURCE_NAME` if not provided.        |

## Configure the HCP Provider

Make sure that you’re not setting values for the `HCP_CRED_FILE`environment variables as these will conflict with the dynamic credentials authentication process.

### Specifying Multiple Configurations

~> **Important:** If you are self-hosting [Terraform Cloud agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents), ensure your agents use [v1.15.1](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog#1-15-1-05-01-2024) or above. To use the latest dynamic credentials features, [upgrade your agents to the latest version](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog).

You can add additional configurations to handle multiple distinct HCP setups, enabling you to use multiple [provider aliases](/terraform/language/providers/configuration#alias-multiple-provider-configurations) within the same workspace.

For more details, see [Specifying Multiple Configurations](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/specifying-multiple-configurations).

#### Required Terraform Variable

To use additional configurations, add the following code to your Terraform configuration. This lets HCP Terraform supply variable values that you can then use to map authentication and configuration details to the correct provider blocks.

```hcl
variable "tfc_hcp_dynamic_credentials" {
  description = "Object containing HCP dynamic credentials configuration"
  type = object({
    default = object({
      credential_file = string
    })
    aliases = map(object({
      credential_file = string
    }))
  })
}
```

#### Example Usage

```hcl
provider "hcp" {
  credential_file = var.tfc_hcp_dynamic_credentials.default.credential_file
}

provider "hcp" {
  alias = "ALIAS1"
  credential_file = var.tfc_hcp_dynamic_credentials.aliases["ALIAS1"].credential_file
}
```
