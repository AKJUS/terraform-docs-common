# Fetch and review configuration versions

This guide explains how to fetch new Stack configurations and reviews them in HCP Terraform.

## Requirements

To view a Stack and its configurations, you must also be a member of a team in your organization with one of the following permissions:
* [Organization-level **Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects)
* [Project-level **Maintain**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#read) or higher

## Fetch new configurations

If you are not already on your Stack’s deployment page, navigate to it:

1. In the navigation menu, click **Projects** under **Manage**.  
1. Select the project containing your Stack.  
1. Click **Stacks** in the navigation menu.  
1. Select the Stack you want to review.

Stacks automatically detect when you push changes to your configuration from your VCS-linked repository. Every time you push changes to your repository, HCP Terraform automatically fetches your configuration and creates a new configuration version.

If something changes outside of your configuration, you can fetch your configuration manually by clicking **Fetch Configurations from VCS** on a Stack’s **Overview** page or clicking **Fetch configuration** on a Stack’s **Configurations** page. For example, if someone changes resources directly in the AWS console, you can manually fetch your configuration to update your Stack.

## Create configuration versions

Whether manual or automatic, every time HCP Terraform fetches a new version of your configuration file, it creates a new configuration version, whether you made changes to that file or not.

HCP Terraform then creates a new plan to roll out that new configuration version to your deployments. Learn more about [reviewing and approving deployment plans](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans). 

### Review configurations

To review your configuration versions, click **Configurations** in the side navigation menu of your Stack.

The **Configurations** page lists the available configuration versions of your Stack. The top-level dashboard lists your configurations and the percentage of deployments that use each configuration version.

Clicking on an individual configuration version reveals more details, including:

* The ID of the configuration version.  
* The latest commit that HCP Terraform based this configuration version on.  
* The deployments using this configuration version.  
* The corresponding plans for each deployment, along with what triggered each plan. Clicking **Quick View** next to a plan lists the differences introduced in that plan.

You can use the **Deployment** filter to filter by deployment name or the **Status** filter to filter by plan status.

### Download configuration data

While in public beta, we want to enable those using Stacks to download helpful information to help debug and analyze how your Stack changes over time.  

Using the  **Inspect** drop-down allows you to gather additional information about your configuration:

* Selecting **Configuration event stream** downloads a log file of your configuration’s events.  
* Selecting **Provider schemas** downloads the schema of the providers of your configuration version.   
* Selecting **Source bundle** downloads the files from which HCP Terraform built this configuration version.

## Next steps

Check out a Stack’s **Overview** page to see a chart of which deployment uses which configuration version and [approve or discard deployment plans](/terraform/language/stacks/plans) to manage your deployments.
