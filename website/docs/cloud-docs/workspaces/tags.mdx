# Create workspace tags

This topic describes how to attach tags to your workspaces. 

## Overview

Tagging workspaces helps you organize, sort, and filter workspaces in the UI. 

You can define key-value pairs to help you organize your workspaces and use them to sort by cost center, for example, to help you track resource consumption. You can define tags while [creating the workspace](#create-a-workspace) or create and attach them to an existing workspace.


### Updates to HCP Terraform tags <sup>BETA</sup>

HCP Terraform now supports tags defined as key-value pairs. Additionally, you can apply key-value tags to projects and not just workspaces. When bound to a project, key-value tags are inherited by workspaces in the project.

You can also reserve tag keys for the organization. Reserved tags appear as suggestions when people create tags for projects and workspaces so that you can use consistent terms for tags throughout the organization.

Tags based on key-value pairs and tag inheritance increase the flexibility of HCP Terraformâ€™s tagging and open new possibilities for governance, reporting, and chargeback use cases. These changes bring us closer to being able to synchronize HCP Terraform tags with infrastructure resources at apply time.

Refer to the following topics for details about using key-value tags:

- [Create project tags](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage#define-project-tags)
- [Create workspace tags](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/create#define-workspace-tags)
- [Migrate single-value tags to key-value tags](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/create#migrating-to-key-value-tags)

HCP Terraform still supports single-value tags that you may have added prior to this update, but you can no longer create new single-value tags or manage existing tags in the HCP UI. We have not changed how single-value tags function. Refer to the following topics in the Terraform CLI and configuration language documentation for additional information:

- [`terraform{}.cloud{}.workspaces` reference](/terraform/language/terraform#terraform-cloud-workspaces)
- [Define connection settings](/terraform/cli/cloud/settings#define-connection-settings)


#

Functionality associated with key-value tags is in beta. Refer [2024-09-12](/terraform/cloud-docs/changelog#2024-09-12) in the changelog for additional information.

The tag management interfaces only support tags stored as key-value pairs. If your organization contains existing single-string tags, you must use the workspace API to manage the tags. Refer to [Workspaces API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces) for additional information.

You can also migrate existing single-value tags to the key-value scheme. Refer to [Migrating to key-value tags](#migrating-to-key-value-tags) for instructions.

You cannot create tags for a workspace using the CLI.

Complete the following steps to define workspace tags:

1. Open your workspace.
1. Click either the count link for the **Tags** label or **Manage Tags** in the **Tags** card on the right-sidebar to open the **Manage workspace tags** drawer.
1. Click **+Add tag** to define a new key-value pair. The following rules apply to tag keys and values:
    - Tags must be one or more characters.
    - Tags have a 255 character limit.
    - Tags can include letters, numbers, colons, hyphens, and underscores.
    - Tag values are optional.
1. Tags inherited from the project appear in the **Inherited Tags** section. You can attach new key-value pairs to their projects to override inherited tags. Refer to [Manage projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage) for additional information about using tags in projects.

   You cannot override reserved tag keys created by the organization administrator. Refer to [Create and manage reserved tags](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#create-and-manage-reserved-tags) for additional information.

   You can also click on tag links in the **Inherited Tags** section to view workspaces that use the same tag.
1. Click **Save**.

Tags that you create appear in the tags management screen in the organization settings. Refer to [Organizations](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations) for additional information.


## Migrating to key-value tags

You can use the API to migrate single-value tags that may already be in your workspace tags to tag stored as key-value pairs. You must have permissions in the workspace to perform the following task. Refer to [Requirements](#requirements) for additional information.

### Re-create existing workspace tags as resource tags

1. Send a `GET` request to the [`/organizations/:organization_name/tags`](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/organization-tags#list-tags) endpoint to request all workspaces for your organization. The response may span several pages.
1. For each workspace, check the `tag-names` attribute for existing tags.
1. Send a `PATCH` request to the [`/workspaces/:workspace_id`](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#update-a-workspace) endpoint and include the `tag-binding` relationship in the request body for each workspace tag.

### Delete single-value workspace tags

1. Send a `GET` request to the [`/organizations/:organization_name/tags`](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/organization-tags#list-tags) endpoint to request all workspaces for your organization.
1. Enumerate the external IDs for all tags.
2. Send a `DELETE` request to the [`/organizations/:organization_name/tags`](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/organization-tags#delete-tags) endpoint to delete tags.
