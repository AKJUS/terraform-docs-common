# Notifications

HCP Terraform can use webhooks to notify external systems about run progress, change requests, and other events. Team notifications allow you to configure relevant alerts that notify teams you specify whenever a certain event occurs. 

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/notifications.mdx'

You can configure an individual team notification to notify up to twenty teams. To set up notifications for teams using the API, refer to the [Notification API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/notification-configurations#team-notification-configuration).
