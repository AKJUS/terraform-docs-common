# Example Customizations

## Customizing a Catalog Item

This example use case creates a Terraform Catalog Item for requesting resources
with custom variable values passed to the Terraform configuration.

### Make a copy of the existing Catalog Item

The application provides pre-configured [Catalog
Items](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)
for immediate use. We suggest creating a copy of the most recent version of the
Catalog Item to ensure you have access to the latest features and
improvements. Make a copy of the most appropriate Catalog Item for your specific
business requirements by following these steps:

1. In All > Service Catalog > Catalogs > Terraform Catalog, review the available
   Catalog Items and identify those based on Flows, which are denoted by the
   suffix "Flow" in their names. When selecting a Catalog Item, it is highly
   recommended to choose those based on Flows rather than Workflows. Flows
   represent ServiceNow's latest and more advanced solution compared to
   Workflows. Flows provide enhanced functionality, improved performance, and
   are actively supported and developed by ServiceNow. On the other hand,
   Workflows are an older technology and may have limited support and updates in
   the future (for more information, refer to the documentation on [Catalog
   Items based on Flows vs.
   Workflows](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)).
1. Open the chosen Catalog Item in the editing mode: 
   1. Click on the Catalog Item to open the request form. 
   1. Click on the three dots located in the top right corner of the screen. 
   1. Select "Configure Item" from the menu.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-configure-item.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item dropdown menu")
1. Access the "Process Engine" tab within the Catalog Item configuration. Take
   note of the Flow name associated with the Catalog Item, as you will need to
   create a copy of this Flow as well.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Process Engine](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-process-engine.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item – Process Engine tab")
1. Initiate the copying process: 
   1. Click on the "Copy" button above the "Related Links" section. 
   1. Assign a new name to the copied Catalog Item. 
   1. Optionally, modify the description and short description fields to better
   reflect the purpose of the new Catalog Item. Right-click on the header and
   select "Save".
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Copy Item](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-copied-item.png "Screenshot of the copied ServiceNow Catalog Item")

By following these steps, you can create a customized Catalog Item tailored to
your specific business needs, using the pre-existing Catalog Items as a starting
point.

### Adjust the Variable Set

When selecting a Catalog Item that requires end users to input variable values,
you have the ability to tailor the variable set according to your needs.
Although some default Catalog Items come with pre-defined example variables, it
is common practice to remove these and replace them with your own custom
variables. The manner in which the example variables are configured and
transmitted to the backend scripts of the application can serve as a helpful
reference when defining your own variables.

1. Create a new Variable Set.
   1. On the Catalog Item's configuration page, under the "Related Links"
      section, navigate to the Variable Sets tab.
   1. Click the "New" button to create your own Variable Set. Ensure that the
   variables in your new set match the variables required by your Terraform
   configuration.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variable Set](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-new-varset.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new Variable Set")
   1. Select "Single-Row Variable Set" and provide a title and description.
   Click "Submit". Upon submission, you will be redirected back to the Catalog
   Item's configuration page.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variable Set Form](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-new-varset-form.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new Variable Set")
   1. Click on the name of your newly created Variable Set and begin creating
   variables. Click the "New" button to create a new variable. It is important
   to follow the [naming convention for Terraform
   variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#terraform-variables-and-servicenow-variable-sets)
   when providing a variable name. Failure to follow the naming convertion will
   result in the backend scripts not recognizing it as Terraform variables.
   ServiceNow offers various types of variable representation (strings,
   booleans, dropdown menues, etc.). Consult the [ServiceNow documentation on
   variables](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ServiceCatalogVariables.html&version=latest)
   and select the types that best suit your use case. You can also set default
   values for the variables in the "Default Value" tab, which will be prefilled
   for the end users on the request form. Create as many variables as required
   by your Terraform configuration.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variables](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-variables.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new variables")
2. Attach the newly created Variable Set to your custom Catalog Item and remove
the default Workspace Variables.
   1. Return to the Variable Sets tab on the Catalog Item's configuration page
   and click the "Edit" buttton. 
   1. Move the "Workspace Variables" Set from the right side to the left side
   and click "Save". This action will remove the example variables from the
   form, leaving only your custom variables. You should not remove the
   "Workspace Request Create" or the "Workspace Request Update" Sets, as they
   contain mandatory variables and should not be modified.

### Make a copy of the Flow and Action

1. In your ServiceNow instance, access the Flow Designer using one of the
   following methods:
   1. Open the ServiceNow Studio through All > Studio and navigate to the
      "Terraform" application. Once in the "Terraform" application, navigate to
      "Flow Designer" > "Flows".
   1. Another way to access the same interface is to type "Flow Designer" in the
   "All" search field of your ServiceNow instance and select "Flows". Once in
   the Flow Designer, locate the Flow referenced in the Process Engine tab of
   the Catalog Item that you have copied. For example, the Flow might be named
   "Provision Resources With Vars". To quickly find the desired Flow, you can
   filter the list of Flows by setting the Application to "Terraform".
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Flow Designer Interface](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-original-flow.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – selecting a Flow")
1. After locating the Flow referenced in your Catalog Item, open it and click on
   the three dots in the top right corner of the Flow Designer interface. From
   the dropdown menu, select "Copy flow". A dialog box will appear, prompting
   you to provide a new name for the copied Flow. Enter a suitable name and
   click "Copy" to create a duplicate of the original Flow.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Copy Flow Interface](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-copy-flow.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – copying a Flow")
1. Customize your newly copied Flow by clicking the "Edit flow" button.
![Screenshot: ServiceNow Edit New Flow Interface](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-edit-flow.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – editing a Flow")
   1. The Trigger should remain "Service Catalog" without any changes.
   1. In the first Action, "Get Catalog Variables":
      1. Keep the "Requested Item Record" in the "Submitted Request" field
         without changes.
      1. Select your newly created Catalog Item from the dropdown menu for
         "Template Catalog Item".
      1. Move all of your variables to the "Selected" side in the "Catalog
         Variables" section. Remove any previous example variables from the
         "Available" side.
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Get Variables Flow Step](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-get-variables.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – getting Variables step")
      1. Click "Done" to finish configuring this Action.
   1. Unfold the second Action in the Flow and click on the arrow to open it in
      the Action Designer.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Open Action Designer](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-open-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Action Designer")
      1. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner and select "Copy Action".
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Copy Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-copy-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Copy Action")
         Rename it and click "Copy".
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Rename Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-rename-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Rename Action")
      1. In the the Inputs section, remove any previous example variables.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Remove Variables From Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-remove-example-variables-from-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Action Input Variables")
      1. Add your custom variables by clicking the "Create Input" button. Ensure
         that the variable names match your Catalog Item variables. Select the
         appropriate type for each variable. Click "Save" at the top to save the
         changes.
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Add Variables To Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-add-variables-to-action.png "Screenshot of adding ServiceNow Action Input Variables")
      1. Open the "Script step" within the Action. Remove any example variables
         and add your custom variables by clicking "Create Variable" at the
         bottom. Enter the name of each variable and drag the corresponding data
         pill from the right into the "Value field".
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Add Script Step Variables To Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-adjust-script-variables.png "Screenshot of adjusting ServiceNow Action Script Variables")
      1. Click "Save" and then "Publish" to save the changes made to the Action.
1. Finally, reopen the Flow and attach the newly created Action to the Flow
   after "Get Catalog Variables" step:
   1. Remove the previous Action that you copied earlier and replace it with
      your newly created Action.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Replace Action Step](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-replace-action.png "Screenshot of replacing ServiceNow Action step")
   1. Connect the new Action to the Flow by dragging and dropping the data pills
      from the "Get Catalog Variables" Action to the corresponding inputs of
      your new Action. Click "Done" to save this step.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Fill Variables for Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-fill-new-action-step.png "Screenshot of filling out ServiceNow Action variables")
   1. Once the Flow is properly configured, click "Save" at the top to save the
      changes.
   1. Click "Activate" to enable your Flow and make it available for use.
