# Example Customizations

## Customizing a Catalog Item

This example use case creates a Terraform Catalog Item for requesting resources
with custom variable values passed to the Terraform configuration.

### Make a copy of the existing Catalog Item

The application provides pre-configured [Catalog
Items](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)
for immediate use. We suggest creating a copy of the most recent version of the
Catalog Item to ensure you have access to the latest features and
improvements. Make a copy of the most appropriate Catalog Item for your specific
business requirements by following these steps:

1. In All > Catalogs > Terraform Catalog, review the available Catalog Items and
   identify those based on Flows, which are denoted by the suffix "Flow" in
   their names. When selecting a Catalog Item, it is highly recommended to
   choose those based on Flows rather than Workflows. Flows represent
   ServiceNow's latest and more advanced solution compared to Workflows. Flows
   provide enhanced functionality, improved performance, and are actively
   supported and developed by ServiceNow. On the other hand, Workflows are an
   older technology and may have limited support and updates in the future (for
   more information, refer to the documentation on [Catalog Items based on Flows
   vs.
   Workflows](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)).
1. Open the chosen Catalog Item in the editing mode: 
   1. Click on the Catalog Item to open the request form. 
   1. Click on the three dots located in the top right corner of the screen. 
   1. Select "Configure Item" from the menu.
1. Access the "Process Engine" tab within the Catalog Item configuration. Take
   note of the Flow name associated with the Catalog Item, as you will need to
   create a copy of this Flow as well.
1. Initiate the copying process: 
   1. Click on the "Copy" button. 
   1. Assign a new name to the copied Catalog Item. 
   1. Optionally, modify the description and short description fields to better
   reflect the purpose of the new Catalog Item. Right-click on the header and
   select "Save".

By following these steps, you can create a customized Catalog Item tailored to
your specific business needs, using the pre-existing Catalog Items as a starting
point.

### Adjust the Variable Set

When selecting a Catalog Item that requires end users to input variable values,
you have the ability to tailor the variable set according to your needs.
Although some default Catalog Items come with pre-defined example variables, it
is common practice to remove these and replace them with your own custom
variables. The manner in which the example variables are configured and
transmitted to the backend scripts of the application can serve as a helpful
reference when defining your own variables.

1. Create a new Variable Set.
   1. On the Catalog Item's configuration page, navigate to the Variable Sets tab.
   1. Click the "New" button to create your own Variable Set. Ensure that the
   variables in your new set match the variables required by your Terraform
   configuration.
   1. Select "Single-Row Variable Set" and provide a title and description.
   Click "Submit". Upon submission, you will be redirected back to the Catalog
   Item's configuration page.
   1. Click on the name of your newly created Variable Set and begin creating
   variables. Click the "New" button to create a new variable. It is important
   to follow the [naming convention for Terraform
   variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#terraform-variables-and-servicenow-variable-sets)
   when providing a variable name. Failure to follow the naming convertion will
   result in the backend scripts not recognizing it as Terraform variables.
   ServiceNow offers various types of variable representation (strings,
   booleans, dropdown menues, etc.). Consult the [ServiceNow documentation on
   variables](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ServiceCatalogVariables.html&version=latest)
   and select the types that best suit your use case. You can also set default
   values for the variables, which will be prefilled for the end users on the
   request form. Create as many variables as required by your Terraform
   configuration.
2. Attach the newly created Variable Set to your custom Catalog Item and remove
the default Workspace Variables.
   1. Return to the Variable Sets tab on the Catalog Item's configuration page
   and click the "Edit" buttton. 
   1. Move the "Workspace Variables" Set from the right side to the left side and
   click "Save". This action will remove the example variables from the form,
   leaving only your custom variables. You should not remove the "Workspace
   Request Create" or the "Workspace Request Update" Sets, as they contain
   mandatory variables and should not be modified.

### Make a copy of the Flow and Action

1. In your ServiceNow instance, access the Flow Designer using one of the following methods:
   1. Open the ServiceNow Studio through All > Studio and navigate to the "Terraform" application. Once in the "Terraform" application, navigate to "Flow Designer" > "Flows".
   1. Type "Flow Designer" in the "All" search field of your ServiceNow instance and select "Flows".
   Once in the Flow Designer, locate the Flow referenced in the Process Engine tab of the Catalog Item that you have copied. For example, the Flow might be named "Provision Resources With Vars". To quickly find the desired Flow, you can filter the list of Flows by setting the Application to "Terraform".
1. After locating the Flow referenced in your Catalog Item, open it and click on the three dots in the top right corner of the Flow Designer interface. From the dropdown menu, select "Copy flow". A dialog box will appear, prompting you to provide a new name for the copied Flow. Enter a suitable name and click "Copy" to create a duplicate of the original Flow.
1. Customize your newly copied Flow by clicking the "Edit flow" button.
   1. The Trigger should remain "Service Catalog" without any changes.
   1. In the first Action, "Get Catalog Variables":
      1. Keep the "Requested Item Record" in the "Submitted Request" field without changes.
      1. Select your newly created Catalog Item from the dropdown menu for "Template Catalog Item".
      1. Move all of your variables to the "Selected" side in the "Catalog Variables" section. Remove any previous example variables from the "Available" side.
      1. Click "Done" to finish configuring this Action.
   1. Unfold the second Action in the Flow and click on the arrow to open it in the Action Designer.
      1. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner and select "Copy Action". Rename it and click "Copy".
      1. In the the Inputs section, remove any previous example variables.
      1. Add your custom variables by clicking the "Create Input" button. Ensure
         that the variable names match your Catalog Item variables. Select the
         appropriate type for each variable. Click "Save" at the top to save the
         changes.
      1. Open the "Script step" within the Action. Remove any example variables
         and add your custom variables by clicking "Create Variable" at the
         bottom. Enter the name of each variable and drag the corresponding data
         pill from the right into the "Value field".
      1. Click "Save" and then "Publish" to save the changes made to the Action.
1. Finally, reopen the Flow and attach the newly created Action to the Flow:
   1. Remove the previous Action that you copied earlier and replace it with your newly created Action.
   1. Connect the new Action to the Flow by dragging and dropping the data pills
      from the "Get Catalog Variables" Action to the corresponding inputs of
      your new Action.
   1. Once the Flow is properly configured, click "Save" to save the changes.
   1. Click "Activate" to enable your Flow and make it available for use.

### Set the Flow for your Catalog Item

1. Navigate back to the main menu by clicking on "All" and then go to "Catalogs"
   followed by "Terraform Catalog."
1. Locate your custom Catalog Item and click on the three dots icon at the top
   of the item. From the dropdown menu, select "Configure item."
1. In the configuration settings, click on the "Process Engine" tab.
1. In the "Flow" field, search for the Flow you recently created. Once you find
   it, click on it to select it and then click the "Update" button to save the
   changes.

### Test the Catalog Item

The new item should be available in the Terraform Service Catalog. To make the
new item accessible to your end users via the Service Portal, follow these
steps:
1. Navigate to the configuration page of the item you want to make available as
   descrbed in the previous section.
1. Locate the "Catalogs" field on the configuration page and click on the lock
   icon next to it.
1. In the search bar, type "Service Catalog" and select it from the search
   results. Add "Service Catalog" to the list of catalogs associated with the
   item. Click on the lock icon again to lock the changes.
1. Finally, click the "Update" button at the top of the page to save the
modifications. After completing these steps, your end users will be able to
access the new item through the Service Portal of your ServiceNow instance. The
Service Portal can be accessed by navigating to All > Service Portal Home.
