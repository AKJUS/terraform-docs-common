# VCS Speculative Plan Management

VCS Speculative Plan Management setting automatically cancel's unfinished speculative plans triggered by pull requests when a new commit is pushed in VCS workflows.

## Managing Organization Speculative Plan Settings 

To view and manage an organization’s Speculative Plan settings, click Settings, followed by General under Version Control, then view the Manage speculative plans part of the page.

Once the organization setting is enabled, HCP Terraform will cancel ongoing or pending speculative plans if new commits are received on the same branch.

## Run Details Page

When a newer commit gets pushed to the same branch, a user can see the message mentioning that the run was automatically canceled.

## Updated VCS Status Checks

For non-aggregated status checks, we now show a different message for the auto canceled plan than the normally canceled one (which would show “Terraform plan canceled”).

For aggregated status check, we now include the count of automatically canceled runs in the aggregated result, separating it from the count of manually canceled ones.

Also, in the aggregated status page, we now include the message that the run has been auto canceled, using the same message that we would send for non-aggregated status checks.

## Aggregated Status Page

When more than one run is automatically canceled for a commit, we’ll show an alert text below the "Resources to be changed" section, as a reminder that the section may not reflect a complete result if all the runs of the commit were to reach completion.
